### Position Summary

The Zhang Lab at Institute for Informatics, Data Science, and Biostatistics (I2DB) focuses on developing and applying innovative causal machine learning analytics to electronic health record (EHR) database to support clinical and regulatory decision-making. This position is an unparalleled opportunity for the right applicant to make an impact on the future of health care by building machine learning algorithms to unleash the potential of large-scale real-world patient data. The Data Scientist will take part in challenging projects such as 1) building unsupervised learning models to identify patient subpopulations for precision medicine, 2) developing time-series deep learning and Transformer-based models for disease risk prediction and individualized treatment effect estimation from longitudinal patient record data, and 3) developing federated learning algorithms for treatment effect estimation across multiple institutions. This role will also include collaboration with both internal and external clinical researchers to apply methods for generating real-world evidence from EHR and claims data.
